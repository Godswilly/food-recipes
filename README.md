<h1 align="center">Catalogue of Recipes</h1>

> 
In this project, I built a dynamic catalogue of recipes app using react/redux, Axios, promises, etc.
- `Recipes List page` with a list of recipes that could be filtered by some parameters; in this project, it's a list of recipes that can be filtered by ingredients (shrimp, broccoli, etc.)
- `Recipe Item page` for the recipe details; in this example, the recipe detail page (Preview Recipe)

In this application, a user can search for recipes by category and get a list of all the meals. The user can also click on a particular meal to see the details of the ingredients and instructions on how to prepare it.
